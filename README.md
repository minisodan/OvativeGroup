## Omar Elsegeiny, Mason Myles, Ian King, Bohdan Ivanyshyn, Emily Anderson

Our capstone project, a Python pipeline CLI library, offers a streamlined solution for generating captions from images. By simply providing URL(s) or a directory containing images, our library swiftly delivers insightful captions. Embedded within are pre-trained models for image captioning and optical character recognition, seamlessly integrated with a language generation model (LLM) for cohesive output. Tailored to meet the requirements of our client, Ovative Group, this tool serves as an in-house asset for efficiently captioning advertisements, offering both conciseness and detail in its captions.

You can run this by running the command: 
```
python -m runner
```

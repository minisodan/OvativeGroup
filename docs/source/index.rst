The Problem
-----------

:orange:`Ovative Group` is a digital media and marketing firm that provides analysis of their clients' ads. However, in
order to analyze the ads, they need to describe them. This is often time intensive. They came to us with the request to
design an Image Captioning program that would allow the advertisements to be analyzed easier.


Our Solution
------------

A command-line interface that intakes one or multiple images from a URL(s) or a directory. It then runs the images
through several models and returns those captions in a CSV file. This CSV file, once created, then compiles all future
captions in one place to allow for easier analysis.
